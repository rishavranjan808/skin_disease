Rare Skin Disease Prediction

This project is based on the classification of rare skin diseases using machine learning algorithms and understanding their applicability in real-world applications. The challenges faced in this project will be associated with class imbalance, label accuracy, and data augmentation for rare diseases. This paper explains the steps necessary for the completion of this project i.e. literature review, data augmentation, data processing, model training and evaluation. The skin is the largest organ of our body and it provides a covering to various organs, including the internal organs and the skeleton. It is very important to protect and take care of the skin. The skin gets affected more than any other part of the body due to various factors. The cost of detection of these skin diseases is comparatively very high and thus computer vision can help in bringing this cost down. The author proposed a detection method based on image-processing techniques. The method takes digital images as input and then predicts the disease.
