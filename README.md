# Human Skin Disease Detection
Welcome to the Human Skin Disease Detection. This repository hosts a comprehensive dataset for skin disease images, machine learning models for disease detection. The goal of this project is to address the challenges of skin disease diagnosis and patient education by providing resources for both healthcare professionals and patients.

## Dataset (DermNet Dataset)
The DermNet Dataset is a key component of this project, providing high-quality images related to a wide array of skin diseases, including both common and rare conditions. The dataset's diversity is instrumental in training and evaluating machine learning models to handle various clinical scenarios.

### Key Features:
Diverse Conditions: The dataset includes images of both common and rare skin diseases, making it suitable for robust machine learning model training.

Real-World Data: The images are from real clinical cases, reflecting the complexity and variability encountered in dermatology practice.

Ethical Considerations: Proper consent was obtained for all medical images in the dataset, adhering to ethical standards in medical research.
Regular Updates: The dataset is regularly updated to include new images and conditions, ensuring its relevance for ongoing research.
## Challenges:
Class Imbalance: The dataset includes a wide range of conditions, some of which are underrepresented, leading to class imbalance.

Label Accuracy: Ensuring the accuracy of disease labels in the dataset is critical for model performance.

Data Augmentation: Techniques are necessary to address the scarcity of images for rare conditions.
