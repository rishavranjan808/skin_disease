Rare Skin Disease Prediction
## About the Project

Welcome to the Human Skin Disease Detection and Information Database project. This repository consists of a dataset for skin disease images, machine learning models for disease detection, and an information platform for skin disease education.
The Dataset used here is called as Dermnet [https://dermnetnz.org/image-library]. It has collection of real-world skin disease images and it also includes both common and rare skin conditions, making it an a good fit for training our detection models.
This project aims to address the challenges of skin disease diagnosis and patient education. It provides resources for both healthcare professionals and patients:

### Dataset (DermNet Dataset)

The DermNet dataset is important for this project as it provides high-quality images related to skin diseases.

- The DermNet dataset encompasses a wide range of skin conditions, including common dermatological diseases, as well as rare and uncommon diseases. This diversity is instrumental in training and evaluating machine learning models to handle various clinical scenarios.

- The images included in the dataset are from real-world clinical cases, ensuring that they are very relevant to practical applications in dermatology and healthcare. They reflect the complexity and variability encountered in clinical practice.

- Ethical considerations have been a priority while creating the DermNet dataset. Patients' were informed about it and proper consent has been obtained for the inclusion of their medical images, aligning with ethical standards in research involving medical data.

- The DermNet dataset is still updated and expanded to include new images and conditions. This dynamic nature ensures that it remains a current and valuable resource for research and clinical applications.

- While the dataset is extensive and rich, it also presents challenges related to class imbalance, label accuracy, and data augmentation for rare conditions. These challenges are an important step of our research efforts.

- You can access the DermNet dataset for research purposes by downloading it from [https://dermnetnz.org/image-library].

By leveraging the DermNet dataset, this project aims to advance the field of dermatology, improve skin disease diagnosis, and empower individuals with accurate information about various skin conditions.

### Machine Learning Models

This project is based on the classification of rare skin diseases using machine learning algorithms and understanding their applicability in real-world applications. The challenges faced in this project will be associated with class imbalance, label accuracy, and data augmentation for rare diseases. This paper explains the steps necessary for the completion of this project i.e. literature review, data augmentation, data processing, model training and evaluation. The skin is the largest organ of our body and it provides a covering to various organs, including the internal organs and the skeleton. It is very important to protect and take care of the skin. The skin gets affected more than any other part of the body due to various factors. The cost of detection of these skin diseases is comparatively very high and thus computer vision can help in bringing this cost down. The author proposed a detection method based on image-processing techniques. The method takes digital images as input and then predicts the disease.
